# Battlecode 2016
This is a copy team **what_thesis**'s Battlecode 2016 submission. I'm making it available here so I can share it with others and give some coding examples.

Team members were Aaron Kuan, Stephen Fleming, Tamas Szalay, and Ryan Rollings, all hailing from Harvard Physics/Applied Physics

## What is Battlecode?
Battlecode is a Java based 'hard core' AI coding competition done every year at MIT. Teams of up to 4 write a distributed AI that controls a team of simulated robots that battle head-to-head against opponents on terrain that's never been seen. Much more about the competition can be found [here](https://www.battlecode.org/contestants/about/).
